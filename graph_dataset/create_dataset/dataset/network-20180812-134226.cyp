Other ancient steel comes from East Africa dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese of the Warring States (403–221 BC) had quench-hardened steel while Chinese of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) created steel by melting together wrought iron with cast iron gaining an ultimate product of a carbon-intermediate steel by the 1st century AD. The Haya people of East Africa discovered a type of high-heat blast furnace which allowed them to forge carbon steel at 1802 °C (3276 °F) nearly 2000 years ago. This ability was not duplicated until centuries later in Europe during the Industrial Revolution.</p></blockquote>'}) RETURN Id(t);
